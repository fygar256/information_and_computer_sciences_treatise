The Existence of Information.

Humans are born ignorant, and as they grow, they gain and lose information.

This program simulates the moment when a newborn human acquires information for the first time.

It's the information version of existentialism.

I know, I'm writing this in a very arrogant way, but all it does is randomly select one of two values ​​and assign it to a variable called self.

Written in Python. Run it with `./io.py`.

It uses my own truerand module.

```io.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
    import truerand
def main(): 
    self=None 
    print(f"information source is /dev/random") 
    print("self will get information") 
    print(f"state of no information self={self}") 
    print("self don't know anything.") 
    i=truerand.rand(1)%2 
    print(f"information source is {i}") 
    self=i 
    print(f"self has been given information") 
    print(f"now, self got information self={self}")

if __name__=="__main__": 
    main() 
    exit(0)
````

Execution result

````
$io.py
information source is /dev/random
self will get information
state of no information self=None
self doesn't know anything.
information source is 1
self has been given information
now, self got information self=1
$
```

From this, we can say that the assumption that there is a 50/50% chance that the person coming is a programmer when there is absolutely no information is incorrect. 

This is because in this program, the probability of determining i is external to self.

This is objective objectivity. Information objectivity.

True random numbers and completely random numbers can be treated as the same thing, but since true random numbers are not completely random, the probability of determining i will not be exactly 1/2,1/2. 

True random numbers are random numbers from environmental noise pooled by /dev/random/, so their values ​​are, strictly speaking, affected by the environment in which the hardware is located. 

Since they are high-quality random numbers, they can be treated as completely random.

Apparently, there was a theory like this in information philosophy.

Existentialism, simply put, is "different."

I don't think existentialism is a very good thing, but I thought this might be true, so I included it.

Existentialism and existential thought are different. I'm an essentialist, and I believe the essence of everything is important. Sartre is wrong.

Death, the opposite of birth, is achieved by assigning None to self. Resurrection is achieved by assigning information to self again.

I made this with the theme of death and resurrection.

```dr.py
#!/usr/bin/python3
import time
def main(): 
    self=1 
    print("self is living but about to die.\n") 
    print(f"state of information self={self}") 
    print("for a while self living.") 
    time.sleep(3) 
    print("") 
    del self
    print(f"self has died. state of information self is unassigned.") 
    print("for a while self is dead.") 
    print("self will revive.\n") 
    time.sleep(3) 
    self=1 
    print(f"self revived. state of information self={self}") 
    print("end")

if __name__=="__main__": 
    main() 
    exit(0)
````

Execution result

````
$ dr.py
self is living but about to die.

state of information self=1
for a while self living.

self has died. state of information self is unassigned.
for a while self is dead.
self will revive.

self revived. state of information self=1
end

```
Just kidding.

The Internet also has externalities of information. Even if you look at the Internet as a whole, you can see that there is other information out there, and the Internet is not everything. 

The Internet as a whole is supposedly an open system, but if you take a single website, it can be said to be a closed system, and there are suffocating aspects.

In general, externalities of information exist, and the total amount of information in an open system is infinite.

In classical probability theory, the correct assumption is that the probability of landing heads and tails in a single coin toss is equal, 1/2.

Multiple Choice:

In a place with no information, limited range, one winning option, one huge failure, and n options, it's better not to try. 

The probability of winning is 1/n, and the probability of a huge failure is 1/n. A huge failure is irreversible.

If there's a chance of a huge loss, it's better not to participate in the game. That's why gamblers are foolish.

The above is just a complicated explanation of a simple thing.
